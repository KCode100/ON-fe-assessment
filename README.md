- Sass, for some additional styling

## Installation

For local environments...
Install the dependencies and start the server.

npm start
```

For production...
Install the dependencies and run build.

>## Before you start :)
>
>This exercise is split into two parts.
>
>Refer to the `src/pages/home.jsx` file and `src/pages/homeStyles.css` file. You can ignore all the other files within this project.
>
>### The Challenge
>
>#### Part 1: Display API data in a component
>
>This step is to demonstrate a good understanding of JavaScript.
>
>- Using the existing `getData` method, ensure this is triggered when the component is rendered. The data should only be fetched once, and you should not need to edit the >`getData` method.
>- Add the data from the endpoint into the existing state `myData`.
>- Modify the JSX template to iterate the user data returned from the endpoint and display each users first name, last name and picture.
>
>- Filter the users by the "registered" key value and only display those registered between the year 2000 and the year 2010. Include a formatted version of the date with each >user in the template.
>- Add a method which allows you to filter the users by typing in the text box. How could you optimise this behaviour to reduce requests?
>
>Example data from the endpoint:
>
>```
>{
>  "gender": "female",
>  "name": { "title": "Ms", "first": "Michelle", "last": "Perkins" },
>  "location": {
>    "street": { "number": 1408, "name": "Chester Road" },
>    "city": "City of London",
>    "state": "Merseyside",
>    "country": "United Kingdom",
>    "postcode": "V1 6PF",
>    "coordinates": { "latitude": "18.4551", "longitude": "145.3502" },
>    "timezone": { "offset": "-9:00", "description": "Alaska" }
>  },
>  "email": "michelle.perkins@example.com",
>  "login": {
>    "uuid": "bbb1213a-2068-4fdf-9e0e-c46f80231a3a",
>    "username": "whiterabbit344",
>    "password": "11111",
>    "salt": "dxH919e7",
>    "md5": "67e51284a50ca94fca8c003a68bd7bc5",
>    "sha1": "f6cac9b2b6773acb02796a296e73b99e8bf4032c",
>    "sha256": "bb729e69bedc5de88c19ffd9d30e751fdae2d292abddb95b6dc698507703768b"
>  },
>  "dob": { "date": "1968-01-18T09:29:17.529Z", "age": 53 },
>  "registered": { "date": "2019-09-16T16:53:21.065Z", "age": 2 },
>  "phone": "0151 014 2914",
>  "cell": "0794-516-201",
>  "id": { "name": "NINO", "value": "BA 17 03 80 P" },
>  "picture": {
>    "large": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/50.jpg",
>    "medium": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/med/women/50.jpg",
>    "thumbnail": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/thumb/women/50.jpg"
>  },
>  "nat": "GB"
>}
>```
>
>#### Part 2: Style the component
>
>This step is for you to show ability at applying styles to HTML.
>
>- Display each user as a "card" - a white box with a soft box shadow and rounded corners.
>- Move the first name and last name so they sit alongside the images but vertically centered and well spaced.
>
>Beyond the above, you can go further than this. Custom web fonts, icons, colours, gradients - feel free to explore creative side without limits.
>
>### What we're looking for
>
>To give you some tips with your code, here's some qualities we're looking for in your solution.
>
>- Appropriate use of semantic HTML elements
>- Clean, concise and readable code
>- Demonstration of understanding of CSS principles and modern best-practise
>- An eye for detail and an appreciation of things looking good
>- Solid consideration of accessibility and usability
>- Minimal reliance on libraries and frameworks, demonstration of solid fundamental JavaScript knowledge
